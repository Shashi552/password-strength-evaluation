# Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

## Passwords Tested

| Password             | Score (%) | Time to Crack         | Feedback                               |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| password123          | 20%       | Less than 1 second    | Too short, dictionary word used        |
| Myp@ssword           | 55%       | Few hours             | Add more symbols & length              |
| T!m3T0W!n#2025       | 90%       | Centuries             | Strong mix of characters               |
| G^r8z&J7@!lQpW4mR2   | 100%      | Millions of years     | Excellent — long, random, varied chars |

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords
1. Use at least 12–16 characters.
2. Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
3. Avoid dictionary words and personal information.
4. Use passphrases for better memorability.
5. Change passwords regularly.

## Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force**: Tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses a list of common words and passwords to guess quickly.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses leaked username-password pairs from previous breaches.

## Conclusion
Longer passwords with high complexity greatly improve security against brute force and dictionary attacks. Using passphrases and password managers is highly recommended.
